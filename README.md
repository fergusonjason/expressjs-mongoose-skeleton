# expressjs-mongoose-skeleton
My Personal Express/Mongoose/Passport/Winston/etc Project Skeleton

## Purpose
This is meant to give me an starting point to create REST api's without having to create the boilerplate code first. You are
welcome to use it, but if you don't understand the underlying technologies, you are probably shooting yourself in the foot.

## Technologies
It's amazing how much stuff you have to use to create a "simple" project, isn't it?

- Node (duh)
- ExpressJS - HTTPS request handling
- Mongoose - Interfacing with MongoDB
- PassportJS - authentication (username/password and JSON Web Token)
- Winston - logging
- Babel - I like using ES2015, what can I say?
- Mocha/Chai/Sinon - Unit testing stuff
- node-config - I want to have different profiles for dev/test/prod
